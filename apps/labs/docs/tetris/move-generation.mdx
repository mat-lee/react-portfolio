# Visualizing Move Generation in Tetris

When building a Tetris AI, one fundamental challenge is determining all the positions where a piece can legally be placed. This involves simulating all possible sequences of moves (left, right, rotate, soft drop) to find every reachable position.

## Interactive Demo

Draw on the board to create obstacles, select a piece, and watch the algorithm explore all reachable positions:

## Algorithms

### Brute Force
Explores every possible state through BFS. Guarantees finding all reachable positions but can be slow.

### Hard Drop Only
Only considers positions reachable by hard drop from the spawn point. Much faster but misses tucked positions.

### Faster But Loss
A hybrid approach that trades some completeness for speed. Good for real-time applications.
