A common starting point for modeling asset prices is the Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM), which is described by the following stochastic differential equation:\n\n$$ dS_t = \\mu S_t dt + \\sigma S_t dW_t $$\n\nIn this equation, $S_t$ represents the asset price at time $t$, $\\mu$ is the drift coefficient (the expected return), and $\\sigma$ is the volatility coefficient. The term $dW_t$ represents a Wiener process or Brownian motion."
